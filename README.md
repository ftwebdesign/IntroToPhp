# Intro to php

2. [Kint](http://kint-php.github.io/kint/) - Awesome package that helps you to debug - forget `var_dump` and `print_r`. You are going to love Kint.
3. [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) - Oh man, you will wonder why this isn't built into PHP. When an error occurs, this displayer replaces out the PHP orange table and gives you information you can actually use.
